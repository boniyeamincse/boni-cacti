## Features
- Pre-configured Apache web server with PHP support.
- MySQL database setup for Cacti.
- SNMP and RRDTool support for monitoring and graphing.
- Easy-to-use Docker setup.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Cacti.

## Getting Started

### Build the Docker Image
1. Clone this repository or download the `Dockerfile` and `cacti.conf` files.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`.
3. Build the Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t cacti-docker .
   ```

### Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, you can run the container using the following command:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 3306:3306 --name cacti-container cacti-docker
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 80 of the container to port 8080 on the host.
- `-p 3306:3306`: Maps port 3306 of the container to port 3306 on the host (for MySQL).
- `--name cacti-container`: Names the container for easier management.

## Accessing Cacti
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/cacti`.
2. Follow the Cacti installation wizard to complete the setup.
   - Database Name: `cacti`
   - Database User: `cacti`
